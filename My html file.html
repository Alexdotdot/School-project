<h1><font color="#efefef" face="arial">Interchangeable parts</font></h1>
<h3><font color="#ffffff" face="arial">The idea of interchangeable parts revolutionized the engineering field and created more efficient methods repair. This meant companies can hire a larger workforce. A more large work force increased product output as well as more jobs for the population. This idea also contributed an advantage for America during the war of 1812 against the British.</font></h3>

<h1><font color="#efefef" face="arial">The Steam Engine</font></h1>
<h3><font color="#ffffff" face="arial">The Steam Engine used the energy from hot Steam to push a rotary object that then provided torque to its designated propellant. This engine was significant because it provided the foundation for many other inventions such as the steam locomotive.</font></h3>
<h3><font color="#ffffff" face="arial">Invented by Thomas Savery</font></h3>

<h1><font color="#efefef" face="arial">The Steam Boat</font></h1>
<h3><font color="#ffffff" face="arial">The Steam Boat used a mechanism called the Steam Engine to bring torque to one or more fans that will turn and provide thrust on water. This invention was significant because it allowed boats to travel upstream.</font></h3>
<h3><font color="#ffffff" face="arial">Invented by Robert Fulton</font></h3>

<h1><font color="#efefef" face="arial">The Bessemer Process</font></h1>
<h3><font color="#ffffff" face="arial">The Bessemer Process was a method of creating steel from a material called pig Iron. This provided a low cost method of converting iron to steel. The Bessemer Process was important because it shifted America's metal from iron to steel.</font></h3>
<h3><font color="#ffffff" face="arial">Invented by Sir Henry Bessemer</font></h3>

<h1><font color="#efefef" face="arial">The Steam Locomotive</font></h1>
<h3><font color="#ffffff" face="arial">The Steam Locomotive was a train powered by the Steam engine. This invention promoted long-distance travel across the country, as well as increased manufacturing production. This made habitation of unpopulated lands more possible, which increased the economy.</font></h3>
